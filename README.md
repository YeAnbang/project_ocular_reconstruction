# FLAME: Articulated Expressive 3D Head Model

This is an official [FLAME](http://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/) repository. 

We also provide [Tensorflow FLAME](https://github.com/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME) and [PyTorch FLAME](https://github.com/HavenFeng/photometric_optimization) frameworks, and code to [convert from Basel Face Model to FLAME](https://github.com/TimoBolkart/BFM_to_FLAME).

FLAME is a lightweight and expressive generic head model learned from over 33,000 of accurately aligned 3D scans. FLAME combines a linear identity shape space (trained from head scans of 3800 subjects) with an articulated neck, jaw, and eyeballs, pose-dependent corrective blendshapes, and additional global expression blendshapes. For details please see the [scientific publication](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/uploads_file/attachment/attachment/400/paper.pdf)

This codebase demonstrates
 * **Sampling:** Load and evaluate FLAME model for random parameters
 * **Landmark fitting:** Fit FLAME to 3D landmarks
 * **Scan fitting:** Fit FLAME to a 3D scan

### Set-up

The code has been tested with Python 3.6.9.

Clone the git project:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rubikplayer/flame-fitting.git
```

Install pip and virtualenv

```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-venv
```

Set up virtual environment:
```
mkdir <your_home_dir>/.virtualenvs
python3 -m venv <your_home_dir>/.virtualenvs/flame-fitting
```

Activate virtual environment:
```
cd flame-fitting
source <your_home_dir>/.virtualenvs/flame-fitting/bin/activate
```

Make sure your pip version is up-to-date:
```
pip install -U pip
```

Somerequirements can be installed using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install mesh processing libraries from [MPI-IS/mesh](https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh) within the virtual environment.

The scan-to-mesh distance used for fitting a scan depends on Eigen. Either download Eigen for [here](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) OR clone the repository:
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git
```
After downloading Eigen, you need to compile the code in the directory 'sbody/alignment/mesh_distance'. To do this go to the directory:
```
cd sbody/alignment/mesh_distance
```
Edit the file setup.py to set EIGEN_DIR to the location of Eigen. Then type:
```
make
```

### Data

Download the FLAME model [MPI-IS/FLAME](https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/downloads). You need to sign up and agree to the model license for access to the model.

### Demo

 * Load and evaluate FLAME model: `hello_world.py`
 * Fit FLAME to 3D landmarks: `fit_lmk3d.py`
 * Fit FLAME to a 3D scan: `fit_scan.py`

Fitting a scan requires scan and FLAME model to be in the same local coordiante systems. The `fit_scan.py` script provides different options by specifying the variable `scale_unit` to convert from Meters [m] (default), Centimeters [cm], or Milimieters [mm]. Please specify the right unit when running `fit_scan.py`. If the unit of the measurement unit is unknown, choose `scale_unit = 'NA'`.

### Landmarks

<p align="center"> 
<img src="data/landmarks_51_annotated.png" width="50%">
</p>

The provided demos fit FLAME to 3D landmarks or to a scan, using 3D landmarks for initialization and during fitting. Both demos use the shown 51 landmarks. Providing the landmarks in the exact order is essential.
